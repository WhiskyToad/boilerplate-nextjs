# Getting Started with Next.js SaaS Development

Building a SaaS application from scratch can be overwhelming. There are so many decisions to make: which framework to use, how to handle authentication, how to process payments, and more. In this guide, we'll walk through the essentials of building a production-ready SaaS with Next.js.

## Why Next.js for SaaS?

Next.js has become the go-to framework for building modern web applications, and for good reason:

- **Server-Side Rendering** - Fast page loads and better SEO
- **API Routes** - Build your backend right in your Next.js app
- **File-Based Routing** - Intuitive and easy to understand
- **TypeScript Support** - Catch errors before they reach production
- **Excellent Developer Experience** - Hot reload, error overlays, and more

## Essential Components of a SaaS

Every successful SaaS needs these core features:

### 1. Authentication

User authentication is the foundation of any SaaS. You need to:

- Allow users to sign up and log in securely
- Support OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Handle password resets and email verification
- Manage user sessions

**Recommended Solution**: Supabase Auth provides all of this out of the box.

### 2. Database

Your SaaS needs to store user data, application data, and more. Consider:

- PostgreSQL for relational data
- Row Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenant isolation
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates
- Type-safe database queries

**Recommended Solution**: Supabase offers PostgreSQL with RLS and real-time features.

### 3. Payments

To monetize your SaaS, you need a payment system:

- Subscription billing (monthly/annual)
- Usage-based pricing
- Trial periods
- Billing portal for customers

**Recommended Solution**: Stripe handles all payment scenarios.

## Quick Start

Here's how to get started with this boilerplate:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.local.example .env.local

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

## Setting Up Environment Variables

Your `.env.local` file should include:

```bash
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Stripe
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-publishable-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

## Project Structure

Understanding the project structure helps you navigate and extend the boilerplate:

- `src/app/` - Next.js pages and API routes
- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `src/features/` - Feature-specific components
- `src/lib/` - Utility functions and configurations
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `supabase/migrations/` - Database migrations

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics, here's what to do next:

1. **Customize the Landing Page** - Edit `src/config/site-config.ts`
2. **Set Up Your Database** - Run `npm run db:init`
3. **Configure Stripe Products** - Create your pricing tiers
4. **Deploy to Production** - Use Vercel for one-click deployment

## Conclusion

Building a SaaS doesn't have to be complicated. With the right tools and a solid foundation, you can launch your product in days instead of months. This boilerplate gives you everything you need to focus on what makes your SaaS unique.
